## Setting up the Plugin

When you edit your form or your creating a new form, under "Standard Fields" select the MailPoet button. A new field will be added to your form. Now edit that field to setup.

Fill in the required field id numbers for First Name, Last Name and Email address.

If you wish to enable a multi-list selection then enable it and select the lists your users can then select.

If you want just a simple single checkbox then make sure that you have selected the lists from the settings page under "Gravity Forms -> Settings -> MailPoet"

Once you are happy with the settings, press "Save Form". If you haven't added the form to a post/page yet then insert the form to that post/page.

That's it.
